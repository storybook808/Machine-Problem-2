Lab 3 Coffee Shop simulator
This directory includes

* queue.c -- coffee shop simulator assuming the shop can hold
  at most one customer.  You should modify this.

* trafficgen.c -- generates random customer arrivals and
  service times.  You don't need to modify this. I included
  this for your information.
  
* traffic.dat -- Traffic file.  It's the traffic you use
  for this lab

* test.dat -- small sample traffic file used for testing.
  You can create your own.

No make files here.  Just compile using gcc file.c
Then run by typing ./a.out
