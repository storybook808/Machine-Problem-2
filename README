Assignment:
This simulator program has both task 1 and task 2 completed. Queue was added and
an adjustable number of servers were added.

Source File(s):
There are no addition source files added to the program. Assignement was
completed by modifiying the pre-existing "queue.c" file provided by
Dr. Sasaki. A makefile was created for compiling, however I do not count this
as a source file.

* queue.c  -- Coffee shop simulator with two possible servers each with a six
              customer capacity. The max number of servers in the shop can be
	      modified with the MACRO "MAXSERVER", which will adjust the
	      program automatically. The max number of customers per server
	      can be modifed with the MARCO "CAPACITY", which will adjust the
	      program automatically.

* makefile -- Contains the build information for this assignment.

* other    -- Default files provided by Dr. Sasaki. No to minimum changes were
              done to them.

Compiling Instructions:
Simplily enter "make" into the prompt. The makefile will compile the rest.

Run-time Instructions:
Run the simulator by entering "coffeeShop" or "./coffeeShop" into the prompt.
Next, load a sample file as prompted by the simulator. For this example, you
can use "traffic.dat" as the sample file. After, the simulator will prompt you
for the number of servers. Once the number of servers have been selected, the 
simulator will do the rest of the work and the results will be printed to the 
screen.

Note:
I added event text to the simulator for debugging purposes and for fun. If you
want to access these event text, then you must uncomment the MACRO "SCRIPT" from
"queue.c" and recompile. Rerunning the program will result in event text that
narrate the behavior of the customers.
